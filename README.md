# expo-live-activity

`expo-live-activity` is a React Native module designed for use with Expo to manage and display live activities on iOS devices exclusively. This module leverages the Live Activities feature introduced in iOS 16, allowing developers to deliver timely updates right on the lock screen.

## Features
- Start, update, and stop live activities directly from your React Native application.
- Easy integration with a comprehensive API.
- Custom image support within live activities with a pre-configured path.

## Platform compatibility
**Note:** This module is intended for use on **iOS devices only**. When methods are invoked on platforms other than iOS, they will throw an error, ensuring that they are used in the correct context.

## Installation
To begin using `expo-live-activity`, follow the installation and configuration steps outlined below:

### Step 1: Installation
Run the following command to add the expo-live-activity module to your project:
```sh
npm install expo-live-activity
```

### Step 2: Config Plugin Setup
The module comes with a built-in config plugin that creates a target in iOS with all the necessary files. The images used in live activities should be added to a pre-defined folder in your assets directory:
1. **Add the config plugin to your app.json or app.config.js:**
   ```json
   {
      "expo": {
         "plugins": ["expo-live-activity"]
      }
   }
   ```
2. **Assets configuration:**
   Place images intended for live activities in the `assets/live-activity` folder. The plugin manages these assets automatically.

### Step 3: Usage in Your React Native App
Import the functionalities provided by the `expo-live-activity` module in your JavaScript or TypeScript files:
```javascript
import * as LiveActivity from "expo-live-activity";
```

## API
`expo-live-activity` module exports three primary functions to manage live activities:

- **`startActivity(state, styles)`**:
  Start a new live activity. Takes a `state` configuration object for initial activity state and an optional `styles` object to customize appearance. It returns the `ID` of the created live activity, which should be stored for future reference.

- **`updateActivity(activityId, state)`**:
  Update an existing live activity. The `state` object should contain updated information. The `activityId` indicates which activity should be updated.

- **`stopActivity(activityId, state)`**:
  Terminate an ongoing live activity. The `state` object should contain the final state of the activity. The `activityId` indicates which activity should be stopped.

### State Object Structure
The `state` object should include:
```javascript
{
  title: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  date?: number; // Set as epoch time in milliseconds
  imageName?: string; // Matches the name of the image in 'assets/live-activity'
  dynamicIslandImageName?: string; // Matches the name of the image in 'assets/live-activity'
};
```

### Styles Object Structure
The `styles` object should include:
```typescript
{
   backgroundColor?: string;
   titleColor?: string;
   subtitleColor?: string;
   progressViewTint?: string;
   progressViewLabelColor?: string;
   timerType?: DynamicIslandTimerType; // "circular" | "digital" - defines timer appereance on the dynamic island
};
```

## Example Usage
```javascript
const state = {
  title: "Title",
  subtitle: "This is a subtitle",
  date: new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 1000 * 5).getTime(),
  imageName: "live_activity_image",
  dynamicIslandImageName: "dynamic_island_image"
};

const styles = {
  backgroundColor: "#FFFFFF",
  titleColor: "#000000",
  subtitleColor: "#333333",
  progressViewTint: "#4CAF50",
  progressViewLabelColor: "#FFFFFF",
  timerType: "circular"
};

const activityId = LiveActivity.startActivity(state, styles);
// Store activityId for future reference
```
This will initiate a live activity with the specified title, subtitle, image from your configured assets folder and a time to which there will be a countdown in a progress view.
